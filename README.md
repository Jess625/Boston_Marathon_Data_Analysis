## Goals of Project:
* Clean and join three separate datasets (2015, 2016 and 2017 results respectively)
* Explore Data / Understand Trends
    * Average finishing times year over year
    * Distributions of finishing times by year and gender
    * Total number of runners broken down by year, gender and International vs American
    * Average finish time by age and gender
    * Avg 5K split pace (where are runners generally slowing down?) against elevation graph of race course

* The largest percentage of runners across all years finish in the 3:24:27 and 3:49:30 window
* Nearly all runners finish in under 6:20:00
* 2015 runners skewed fastest out of all three years
    * Interesting to look at weather of all three years:
        * April 20, 2015: Overcast with a high of 45F
        * April 18, 2016: Scattered clouds with a high of 66F
        * April 17, 2017: Scattered clouds with a high of 73F
